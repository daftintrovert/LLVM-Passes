First go to____

Home ----> LLVM ----> llvmproject ----> llvm ----> lib ----> Transforms

Create a folder with name MaxBasicBlock(Do not change this name)

Put three things in this :
  1. CMakeLists.txt
  2. MaxBasicBlock.cpp
  3. MaxBasicBlock.exports (You can keep it empty)
  
(All files are provided)

After this navigate to 

Home ----> LLVM ----> llvmproject ----> build ----> lib ----> Transforms

Open your terminal on this path and type $make to build the changes we have done to LLVM.

Now go inside the MaxBasicBlock folder now created and open the terminal on the same path and put command make to build.

After doing so We will be able to create an .so file in ../build/lib as MaxBasicBlock.so

Run our first pass with opt:-

    ./path of LLVM bin directory/opt -load/path of MaxBasicBlock.so -MaxBasicBlock <path of our .ll or .bc file name> /dev/null
