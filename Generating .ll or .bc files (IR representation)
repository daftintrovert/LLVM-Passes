Let's say your new pass code is in folder named MyPass, then add this folder to llvm-project/llvm/lib/Transforms/.
In this folder your code for custom pass should be MyPass.cpp, it should also contain MyPass.exports (this can be left empty) and CMakeLists.txt. 
In this cmake file, add the following

# If we don't need RTTI or EH, there's no reason to export anything
# from the hello plugin.
if( NOT LLVM_REQUIRES_RTTI )
  if( NOT LLVM_REQUIRES_EH )
    set(LLVM_EXPORTED_SYMBOL_FILE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/MyPass.exports)
  endif()
endif()
 
if(WIN32 OR CYGWIN)
  set(LLVM_LINK_COMPONENTS Core Support)
endif()
 
add_llvm_library( MyPass MODULE BUILDTREE_ONLY
  MyPass.cpp
 
  DEPENDS
  intrinsics_gen
  PLUGIN_TOOL
  opt
  )

2. in the file llvm-project/llvm/lib/Transforms/CMakeLists.txt append the line add_subdirectory(MyPass) at the end.
3. now go to the build dir, and run the make command (you can use -j 8 to speed up this process)
4. now create a sample llvm ir file from test.cpp using the following command : clang++ -S -emit-llvm test.cpp, this would produce test.ll
5. now run you pass on test.ll using the command : 
  <path-to-llvm>/llvm-project/build/bin/opt -enable-new-pm=0 -disable-output  -load LLVMMyPass.so  test.ll --mypass,
  the --mypass is the name with which you register the pass in MyPass.cpp.
